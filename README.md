# Editor_indice_Py

The program is a tool developed in Python designed to manipulate the general indices of a binary container file called packfile.bin. This file serves as a package that stores multiple resources, such as data, images, sounds, or configurations, organized in a specific format.

The main goal of the program is to allow users to view, edit, add, or delete entries in the file's indices, making it easier to manage the resources contained within.

P.S.: Donâ€™t expect to see pro-level code.
