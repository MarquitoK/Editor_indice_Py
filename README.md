## Features
The program is a tool developed in Python designed to manipulate the general indices of a binary container file called packfile.bin. This file serves as a package that stores multiple resources, such as data, images, sounds, or configurations, organized in a specific format.

The main goal of the program is to allow users to edit, add, or delete entries in the file's indices

You can also try the **Extract Tool** section, which allows you to extract and compress PCK files, PPHD files, character patches, and other game files.
