# Editor_indice_Py

![Python Version](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)

The program is a tool developed in Python designed to manipulate the general indices of a binary container file called packfile.bin. This file serves as a package that stores multiple resources, such as data, images, sounds, or configurations, organized in a specific format.

The main goal of the program is to allow users to edit, add, or delete entries in the file's indices

P.S.: Don’t expect to see pro-level code.
